# Introduction to Java — Learning Examples

This repository contains small Java example programs organized by lesson topics to help learners progress from basics to more advanced examples.

Structure:

- [`01_basics/README.md`](01_basics/README.md:1) — variables, simple I/O, and elementary programs.
- [`02_control_statements/README.md`](02_control_statements/README.md:1) — conditionals and branching.
- [`03_loops/README.md`](03_loops/README.md:1) — for, while, do-while, and loop examples.
- [`04_nested_loops/README.md`](04_nested_loops/README.md:1) — nested loop patterns and exercises.
- [`05_arrays/README.md`](05_arrays/README.md:1) — one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.
- [`06_file_io/README.md`](06_file_io/README.md:1) — reading/writing files and file-related examples.
- [`07_methods_and_printing/README.md`](07_methods_and_printing/README.md:1) — functions, formatting, and PrintF examples.
- [`08_oop_and_shapes/README.md`](08_oop_and_shapes/README.md:1) — simple OOP examples (circle, rectangle).
- [`09_calculators_and_utils/README.md`](09_calculators_and_utils/README.md:1) — utility programs and calculators.
- [`10_projects_and_tests/README.md`](10_projects_and_tests/README.md:1) — lab projects and test examples.
- [`11_misc/README.md`](11_misc/README.md:1) — misc resources and data files.

How to use

- Browse each folder and run examples with `javac` and `java` from the repository root. Example:
  - Compile: javac 03_loops/Loops1.java
  - Run: java -cp 03_loops Loops1

Conventions

- Files are grouped by lesson topic and named to reflect the example content.
- Compiled `.class` files have been left in place when present (see [`09_calculators_and_utils/CurrencyConverter.class`](09_calculators_and_utils/CurrencyConverter.class:1)).

Notes

- Each folder includes its own README.md describing that lesson and listing the files contained.
- If you want me to remove compiled artifacts, rename files, or adjust grouping, request the change.
