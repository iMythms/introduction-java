# 08_oop_and_shapes

This lesson demonstrates very small object-oriented examples related to shapes (circle, rectangle) to practice classes and simple methods.

Files:
- [`MyCircle.java`](08_oop_and_shapes/MyCircle.java:1)
- [`MyRectangle.java`](08_oop_and_shapes/MyRectangle.java:1)
- [`RectangleHeight.java`](08_oop_and_shapes/RectangleHeight.java:1)

How to run:
- Compile: javac 08_oop_and_shapes/MyCircle.java
- Run: java -cp 08_oop_and_shapes MyCircle

Learning goal: Understand simple class structure, methods, and encapsulation for small examples.
